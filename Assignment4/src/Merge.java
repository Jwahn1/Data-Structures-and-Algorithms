Method 2: Input arguments are two ordered lists; the method creates and returns a new list
that contains the common items in list1 and list2. You would still use the two-finger walking algorithm concept with a
small variation in the pseudocode.
The header for this method would be:

Method 3: Input arguments are two ordered lists; the method creates and returns a new list
that contains the items in list1 but not in list2. You would still use the two-finger walking algorithm concept with a
small variation in the pseudocode.
The header for this method would be:
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> OrderedList<T> difference (OrderedList<T> list1, OrderedList<T> list2)
{
//your code here
}
As an example, suppose we have the following lists:
list1: [Amar, Boris, Charlie, Dan, Fujian, Inder, Pei, Travis]
list2: [Alex, Betty, Charlie, Dan, Travis, Zola, Zulu]
then the first method (merge) should return the list
[Alex, Amar, Betty, Boris, Charlie, Dan, Fujian, Inder, Pei, Travis, Zola, Zulu]
The second method (common) should return the list
[Charlie, Dan, Travis]
The third method (difference) should return the list
[Amar, Boris, Fujian, Inder, Pei]
As you may notice from the above example, the items can be repeated across the two lists, but they are not repeated
within each list. Same with the result lists â€“ items are not repeate
